## September 1 Session Notes

- **1. Clean Code**

  - See the big picture - think about the architecture.
  - Give good names to your code (functions and variables).
    - Good code is easy for others to understand
  - Frequent code review may be physically impossible.

  - Clean code includes sufficient information to understand its logic.
  - **Good naming convention**
    - **Descriptive**: currently popular trends
    - Clarify your intention (what your code does) through the names.

  - **Do's & don'ts**
    - Vague or ambiguous names: ex) process, manager, handler
      - How are your functions going to handle or process data?
    - Tell, don't ask.
    - **Make one function do only one thing.** (fragmentalise!)
  - **Code Review**
    - Author, Reviewer, PR Change list
    - It's not a critique battle. It's about improving the code.
    - Establish policy for code review (code of conduct, respecting team mates).
  - Be generous with example code.

  

  **2. Feedback on programming**

  - Each function should take in own variables.
  - If the functions don't take in variables or return values, it can be difficult to see the flow of data processes.
  - Declare variable type.
